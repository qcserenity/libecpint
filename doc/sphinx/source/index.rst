libecpint : C++ ECP integral library
=====================================

About
=======

libecpint is an open-source library for the calculation of integrals over effective core potentials (ECPs) in quantum chemistry software. It was written predominantly by Robert A. Shaw (@robertshaw383), with some assistance from J. Grant Hill (@Dr_GHill), and a helpful pull request from Peter Kraus (@pk_kraus). It is currently used in at least two major quantum chemistry packages: Psi4 (@PSI_code) and entos (@EntosAI).
