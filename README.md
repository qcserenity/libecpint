Libecpint is a C++ library for the efficient evaluation of integrals over ab initio effective core potentials, using a mixture of generated, recursive code and Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature. It is designed to be standalone and generic, and is now in its first stable release. If you experience any problems please raise an issue here; contributions and suggestions are also welcome.

## New in first full release

- Analytical 1st and 2nd derivatives;
- Integration now >10x faster;
- New, high level API, with ECP library;
- Automated testing suite.

## Dependencies

- A modern C++ compiler, at least C++11 standard library is required. This has currently only been tested with GCC (6.3.0 and above, but will in theory work with any > 4.9) and clang (9.0.0 and above). Intel compilers have been known to cause issues.
- CMake/CTest build tools
- Python (2.7 or above, including 3 and higher)

Additionally, if you wish to regenerate the radial code (see below),  Python >=3.6 is required with numpy and sympy.
